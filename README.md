## Data sources

Primary data source: [graemetlloyd.com](http://www.graemetlloyd.com/matr.html) (as at 05/07/19).

This includes:

1. #NEXUS file (character-taxon matrix inclusive of ASSUMPTIONS block).
2. Sample of most parsimonious trees.
3. XML files with dependency and taxonomic reconciliation data.

But does not include:

1. Temporospatial data for tips (to come from [paleobiodb.org](https://paleobiodb.org/#/)).
2. Bayesian inference posterior samples.

## Data filtering

Following Wright et al. (2016) the following filtering was applied:

1. Text.
2. Text.
3. Text.

Plus:

1. Removing data sets with polymorphisms.
2. Removing data sets with molecular components.

## Age data

## Bayesian inference settings
