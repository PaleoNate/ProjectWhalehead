## Abstract: 
Establishing hypotheses of relationships is a critical
prerequisite for any macroevolutionary analysis, but different
approaches exist for achieving this goal. Amongst palaeontologists using
morphological data the Bayesian approach is increasingly preferred over
parsimony, but this shift also alters the way we think about samples of
trees. Here we revisit stratigraphic congruence as a comparator between
Bayesian and parsimony samples, but in a new visual context: treespace.
Such spaces represent an ordination of unique topologies that can also
be extended to create a "landscape" where altitude represents some
comparative measure (here congruence with stratigraphy). By co-opting
existing visualization tools and applying them to a meta-analysis of 128
cladistic data sets we show that there is no consistent favouring of
either Bayesian or parsimony according to stratigraphic congruence
metrics, and further that empirical treespace visualizations suggest a
complex variety of topological landscapes. We conclude by arguing that
treespaces should become a standard exploratory tool in phylogenetic
analysis.


## INTRODUCTION:

Inferring the tree of life and using phylogenetic trees to understand
organismal form and function are primary challenges of biology.
Phylogenetic trees provide a historical perspective on relationships
between taxa, and performing comparative biological studies without a
phylogenetic context is misleading (Felsenstein 1985). While many
researchers in comparative biology have moved to using molecular
character data to estimate phylogenetic trees, fossils remain the sole
source of character data for many extinct groups. Fossils also provide
the only direct evidence for historical trends in many groups (Cobbett
and Wills 2007; Koch and Parry in press). Excluding fossils from trees
has been demonstrated to bias the inferences we draw from phylogenetic
comparative analyses (Slater *et al.* 2012). Therefore, how to best
include fossils in phylogenetic analyses remains a vital and thriving
research topic.

Phylogenetic analyses of discrete morphological data have traditionally
been conducted under the maximum parsimony criterion, but Bayesian
approaches are increasingly being employed instead. In part this is
because Bayesian implementations allow not just estimation of topology,
but more complex analyses, such as divergence time estimation. Bayesian
methods assume an explicit model of evolution, and allow the researcher
to set priors on each parameter in their model. In effect, this allows
researchers to incorporate prior information and/or intuition about the
value of parameters into their analysis. The most basic and restrictive
model of morphological evolution is the Mk model (Lewis 2001). This
model assumes equal rates of change between each state at a character.
In practice, these assumptions are not much different than the basic
assumptions of an equal-weights parsimony step matrix. However, these
methods calculate a rate-based branch length in expected substitutions
per site, allowing for the accommodation of multiple changes along a
branch (e.g., a 0 state to a 1 state and back again), something
parsimony cannot do. More elaborate models that allow for relaxation of
the core assumptions of the Mk model have been published (Nylander *et
al.* 2004) and evaluated (Wright *et al.* 2016).

Comparing the results of a Bayesian analysis and a parsimony analysis
can be difficult. Bayesian methods estimate what is called the
*posterior sample*. The posterior sample is a set of trees and
associated model parameters that are plausible given the data, the
model, and any priors. Phylogenetic trees are often estimated using
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling (Metropolis *et al.* 1953;
Hastings 1970). Under this algorithm, a tree and model parameters are
proposed and evaluated given the model and priors. In general, if the
tree and model parameters have a better likelihood score than the
previous tree and model parameters, the new solution is kept. MCMC is
considered a memoryless process; that is, the next proposed tree and
model parameters are not chosen based on previously-sampled trees. A
good tree may therefore be visited many times in a Bayesian estimation.
Because an MCMC analysis will visit solutions in proportion to their
likelihood, how often a particular tree or set of relationships appears
in the posterior sample is considered to be a measure of support for
that tree. Usually the researcher will compute a summary tree for
publication, though tools now exist to visualize sets of phylogenetic
trees (Hillis *et al.* 2005; Jombart *et al.* 2017; Warren *et al.*
2017).

This is in stark contrast to parsimony. The aim of parsimony is to
estimate the most parsimonious tree. The most parsimonious tree is the
one that minimizes the number of character changes in the dataset
implied by the tree. Under the criterion of maximum parsimony, a tree is
proposed, and the changes implied in the morphological character matrix
by that tree are counted. A tree is considered better than another if it
has a lower parsimony score. Many datasets will have one tree that
minimizes the parsimony score. In this case, a point estimate of the
phylogeny is typically published by the author. However, in some
datasets several most parsimonious trees may be returned, due to either
lack of signal or conflicting signal. In this case, a summary tree is
usually created. The most common of these is some form of consensus
tree, which displays all phylogenetic relationships that are present in
some proportion of the most parsimonious trees. Common variations
include a strict consensus tree, in which all clades on the summary tree
are represented in all parsimonious trees, and majority rule consensus
trees, in which clades on the summary tree are represented in more than
50% (or some larger fraction) of the set of most parsimonious trees.

How to compare a Bayesian posterior sample and a set of most
parsimonious trees is a fraught topic. There are many aspects of
parsimony analyses that are not strictly comparable to Bayesian
analyses. For example, synapomorphies are interpreted differently in a
Bayesian analysis, as multiple changes can occur along a branch.
Bayesian analyses consider branch lengths (in substitutions per site for
an undated tree) to be parameters of the model. Therefore, Bayesian tree
summarizations take these values into account (Bouckaert *et al.* 2014;
Brown *et al.* 2017; O'Reilly and Donoghue 2017), not solely the
topology. Support values for bipartitions in the tree are calculated as
part of a Bayesian estimation, being the number of times that a set of
relationships is contained in the posterior sample, as a topology can
appear multiple times in a Bayesian sample but is not retained more than
once in a parsimony sample. The assumption is that the sample, not
simply the "best" tree, contains vital information.

Because of these differences, formulating a fair comparison between
parsimony and Bayesian trees is difficult. Most studies to date have
focused on intrinsic comparisons, those comparisons about the tree
itself. For example, most simulation studies to date have simulated data
along a given tree or set of trees. Then, from the simulation data, a
tree has been estimated under both parsimony and Bayesian methods.
Finally, a summary tree for each method is computed and compared to the
tree under which it was simulated. Often, this focuses on the behavior
of the researcher, comparing a Bayesian consensus tree to a parsimony
consensus tree (Wright and Hillis 2014). Most phylogenetic estimates in
published articles are presented as point estimates. Because parsimony
trees are most commonly published as majority-rule or strict consensus
trees, computing this type of summary for both treatments (parsimony and
Bayesian) and comparing them is fairly straightforward. Comparisons have
typically involved tree-based metrics, such as the Robinson-Foulds
(Robinson and Foulds 1979, 1981), which supplies the number of
bifurcations that differ between two trees. While this approach makes
sense for many questions, it also does not include or account for most
of the results associated with Bayesian estimation (the posterior
sample).

An underutilized comparative tool between trees is their stratigraphic
congruence -- how well they match the order of appearance of taxa in the
fossil record. Sansom *et al.* (2018) used stratigraphic congruence to
compare parsimony and Bayesian summary trees to assess which analytical
method produces trees that best fit the fossil record. The most
attractive feature of this approach is that it employs extrinsic
criteria, evaluating how well the tree fits data external to that used
to infer the tree. Stratigraphic congruence methods (Table 1) use
various measures to determine how well an estimated tree fits first and
last appearance data for the fossil tips on this tree. Sansom *et al.*
estimated trees for empirical datasets under both Maximum Parsimony and
Bayesian estimation, computed consensus trees, and calculated
stratigraphic fit for a sample of 500 trees from the posterior, then
averaged those stratigraphic congruences. This is a novel way to
independently compare the fit of trees produced under different
optimality criteria, although previously it has been used to compare
competing hypotheses of relationships for the same set of taxa (Brochu
and Norell 2000; Pol and Norell 2006; Rahman *et al.* 2009). In this
manuscript, we extend this approach to evaluate the whole posterior
sample for stratigraphic fit and, critically, plot stratigraphic fit of
individual trees in the posterior or the set of most parsimonious trees
in "treespace" (Hillis *et al.* 2005). We conclude that averaging a
posterior sample to a summary statistic is an oversimplification, and
encourage the use of more sophisticated visual tools, such as RWTY
(Warren *et al.* 2017) to incorporate the variation in any one metric.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Dataset Filtering

Empirical datasets were downloaded from graemetlloyd.com/matr.html, the
same starting repository used by Sansom *et al.* (2018). We initially
excluded anything molecular, phenetic, ontogenetic or meta-analytical as
these do not represent data sets intended for morphological phylogenetic
inference (our focus here). We additionally removed data sets with
polymorphic or inapplicable characters as these are currently not well
dealt with by Bayesian implementations. In the repository, and more
broadly amongst morphological phylogenetics, many datasets are derived
from older datasets with little or no modification. For example, a
matrix in the repository may have derivative matrices in which
subsequent tax(a) or character(s) were added (see Figure S1 of Hartman
*et al.* 2019 for an excellent illustration of how complicated this
issue can become). For this study, if there were multiple dataset
derivatives, we chose the largest or most expansive dataset using the
same criteria applied by Wright *et al.* (2016) and the appropriate
metadata available in the XML files associated with each data set (Lloyd
*et al.* 2016). The same XML files contain taxonomic reconciliations -
links between OTU names used in the trees with taxa entered into the
Paleobiology Database, the source used for our (and Sansom *et al.*
2018) age data. Using the API (Peters and McClennen 2016) we further
filtered the data down to just those where all taxa are both reconciled
and have age data available in the database (i.e., at least one fossil
occurrence is attributable to each OTU). The final pool comprised 128
different data sets (Lloyd and Wright 2020).

### Phylogenetic Analysis

Each data set was analyzed under both Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian
criteria.

For the Bayesian approach we analysed each dataset under the Mk model in
the software RevBayes (Höhna *et al.* 2014, 2016). We partitioned each
dataset according to the number of states per character in order to
specify an appropriate *Q*-matrix. Among-character rate variation was
parameterized according to a Gamma distribution with four discrete
categories. Branch lengths were drawn from an exponential distribution.
Datasets were run for one million generations, and then assessed
visually for convergence using Tracer (Rambaut *et al.* 2018). The full
posterior sample, and not a point estimate, was taken forward for
analysis in each case.

Maximum Parsimony trees were re-estimated for each data matrix using TNT
(Goloboff and Catalano 2016). Implicit enumeration was used where there
were 24 or fewer tips. For larger tip counts 20 replicates of new
technology searches followed by a round of tree bisection-reconnection
were applied with maxtrees capped at 100,000. All equally most
parsimonious trees are retained here up to this 100,000 limit. Note that
a fairer comparison with Bayesian phylogenetic inference would be to
also include trees a few steps longer, and hence our choice here is to
reflect practical usage (only retaining the most parsimonious trees)
rather than optimality (parsimony) more generally.

*Stratigraphic Congruence*
--------------------------

We calculated stratigraphic congruence values for each tree in the
Bayesian posterior sample, and each most parsimonious tree in the
output. For each dataset, we used the PaleobiologyDBOccurrenceQuerier
function in the metatree R package (github.com/graemetlloyd/metatree) to
query the Paleobiology Database for minimum and maximum ages of each tip
in the analysis. Using the R package strap (Bell and Lloyd 2015), we
calculated several stratigraphic congruence metrics: Minimum Implied Gap
(MIG), Stratigraphic Consistency Index (SCI), Relative Completeness
Index (RCI), Gap Excess Ratio (GER), Manhattan Stratigraphic Measure
(MSM), and Wills' modifications of GER (GERt and GER). An explanation of
these metrics can be seen in Table 1.

For each set of topologies and stratigraphic congruence results, we
plotted a treespace plot in the R package RWTY. RWTY calculates the
topological differences between the trees in the posterior sample using
the Robinson-Foulds metric. This metric calculates the number of splits
that are on one tree, but not the other. Then, RWTY uses a
multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm (Gower 1966) to plot these
differences to 2-D space. We modified RWTY to color points according to
their stratigraphic consistency score. We visualized the set of most
parsimonious trees and the Bayesian posterior sample in the same
treespace plots.

We also conducted a number of tests to verify the patterns we saw in
treespace. MDS scaling can cause distortion of observed distances in the
situation that variation is spread across multiple axes (Hillis et al.
2005). Therefore, we used K-Means testing to verify that regions of
treespace that appear distinct in a treespace plot truly are. We also
plotted the MIG differences and MDS distances directly against one
another to assess if patterns seen on treespace plots persist in this
visualization.

The full set of code and data used are available at both the Dryad
(Lloyd and Wright 2020) and GitHub
(github.com/graemetlloyd/ProjectWhalehead) repositiories.

RESULTS

For direct comparison with Sansom *et al.* (2018), we made boxplots of
the distributions of several stratigraphic congruence measures (Lloyd
and Wright 2020). We made these figures comparing the posterior sample
and the set of most parsimonious trees for each dataset, and each
stratigraphic congruence metric shown in Table 1. Note that a major
difference between a Bayesian sample and a parsimony sample is that the
former can include duplicate trees (those visited multiple times by the
MCMC, and will return all trees visited in the analysis, whereas a
parsimony analysis only returns unique topolog(ies), stripped of any
visit count information). The net result of this is that Bayesian
samples will generally show more points than the parsimony sets of
trees, and often show more variance. Examples of this can be seen in the
boxplots in Figs. 1A and 2A. The spread of stratigraphic congruence
metrics is much higher in the Bayesian analysis and this is typical of
the majority of data sets. For most metrics, the median of the parsimony
sample is lower than the median of the Bayesian sample (Supplementary
Table 1). However, in most instances the stratigraphic congruence of the
most parsimonious tree, or set of trees, is contained within the
quartiles of the boxplot.

We also visualized these data as treespace plots. An example treespace
plot can be seen in Fig. 1C, and the full set of treespace plots is
available in the supplemental material. These multi-dimensional scaling
graphs demonstrate that the Bayesian posterior samples contain many more
trees, including many more trees that are substantially different from
one another, than the parsimony estimations do. This is expected, as the
Bayesian results include the entire posterior sample. In most
estimations, the posterior sample contains (envelops) the parsimony
trees, in addition to other solutions plausible under the model. As
shown in Fig. 1C, it is very possible (and even common) in both Bayesian
and maximum parsimony estimation to have topologies with good
stratigraphic fit appear near trees with poor stratigraphic fit (and for
apparently dissimilar trees to have similar or even identical
stratigraphic fits). This suggests that in some treespaces, there may be
little topological difference between a tree that is quite good with
respect to stratigraphic fit and a tree with poor stratigraphic fit. In
other words, the landscapes of stratigraphic congruence may be highly
volatile - something boxplots cannot capture or suggest. (This can be
shown directly in Fig. 3, where a landscape generated from all possible
trees of six tips is shown.) As in the boxplots, the treespace plots
largely suggest that the parsimony trees fall within the range of
solutions explored in a Bayesian search. It should be noted, however,
that some appearance of volatility can be due to the compression from
multiple axes of variation down to 2 dimensions (Lloyd and Wright 2020).

## DISCUSSION




### Summarizing a posterior sample

The aim of a Bayesian analysis is not a single point estimate of a
solution. Rather, it is to examine solutions and outcomes that are
plausible given the model and the data. This is particularly important
in phylogenetics, where we are estimating lineage divergences that
occurred tens or hundreds of millions of years ago. We do this from
scarce, and likely biased data, using models that may or may not
adequately capture reality. To responsibly present a solution under
these conditions must mean incorporating uncertainty in that solution.
It is prudent to avoid using a single point estimate summary of a
posterior sample, whether a summary tree or an average value computed
across several trees.

The authors of this work are not immune to using a point estimate of
topology from a posterior sample to compare to a point estimate of a
parsimony topology (see Wright and Hillis 2014).

In some cases, this is a pragmatic choice, given that consensus
summaries are common in the literature. But the properties of a Bayesian
analysis are different than a parsimony analysis. A Bayesian analysis
represents solutions that are plausible under a model. In practice, a
typical parsimony analysis, on the other hand, pre-filters trees by
whether or not they are the best under the maximum parsimony criterion.
This means that the Bayesian sample will almost certainly contain more
sub-optimal trees than the parsimony sample. This has the effect, when
stratigraphic congruence measures are averaged for the posterior sample,
of pulling down the mean of the distribution of stratigraphic
consistency values. It should be noted that researchers *could* choose
to retain more of the trees sampled under the parsimony criterion, e.g.
those within five steps of the shortest tree, though this is rarely
done. Doing so will likely result in a wider set of solutions to
visualize.

There is an additional complication to interpreting a Bayesian posterior
distribution: that the distribution itself is meaningful. Because a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis is memoryless, and solutions are
sampled in proportion to their likelihood and the prior, a good solution
will be visited many times. In fact, popular metrics of phylogenetic
support, such as the posterior probability are calculated directly from
the posterior sample for this reason. That the distribution of solutions
itself contains information means that approaches, such as randomly
sampling trees from the posterior, may give some sense of the variation.
But they can also fail to approximate the true distribution of the
posterior, particularly given that the variance in a posterior sample is
unlikely to be normally distributed.

However, it is also not reasonable for researchers to examine every
single tree in a posterior sample. How can a researcher draw reasonable
conclusions from their posterior sample? Over the past five years,
modern and open-source treespace visualization software has become
available. As demonstrated in Fig. 1C (a treespace plot made from the
posterior sample estimated from the Yates 2003 dataset), treespace
visualizations attempt to show the distance between trees in the sample
(but see Hillis *et al.* 2005), and enable researchers to color points
by other factors (formally generating so-called tree "landscapes"; St.
John 2016). As can be seen in Fig. 1C, both the Bayesian and parsimony
analyses predominantly seem to sample two islands of treespace. The
points in this graphic suggest that topologically similar trees can have
wildly different Minimum Implied Gap scores. For this dataset, it does
not appear that certain regions of treespace produce better
stratigraphic congruence. This is in contrast to Fig. 2C (a treespace
plot made from the posterior sample estimated from the Demar 2013
dataset), in which some areas of treespace clearly contain trees that
have better fit to the stratigraphic record. This finding was confirmed
by using K-Means estimation to detect clusters within the sets of MIG
scores per posterior sample (Lloyd and Wright 2020).

Prior research (Hillis et al. 2005) has indicated that visualizing MDS
results in 2-dimensions may compress treespace in a way that can cause
artifacts. Under the MIG metric, two trees that are topologically
similar to one another can produce very different MIG scores, and two
trees that are topologically quite different can produce similar MIG
scores. Therefore, we did a set of estimates comparing the MDS distances
(across all axes) to the MIG differences. These plots (Lloyd and Wright
2020) indicate that while there may be some stressing of treespace, this
generally should not inhibit the use of treespace plots as an
exploratory tool.

### Stratigraphic congruence and optimality criterion

Which analytical method is most congruent with stratigraphy is an
altogether murkier question when the fullness of the posterior sample is
considered. A table of averages for Yates (2003) and Demar (2013) is
provided in Table 2. Here we limit our consideration to just the MIG
metric, as this is both a simple way to capture the key difference
(total implied missing history in millions of years) and is the primary
variable driving three of the four other metrics (GER, MSM\*, and RCI).
The other (SCI) is not favoured here as it treats all implied gaps in
the record the same regardless of their size. As can be seen from Table
2, sometimes the MIG favours the Bayesian posterior sample, sometimes
the set of most parsimonious trees. Overall, 47 of 128 datasets (36.7%)
had lower mean MIG using Bayesian methods (Table S1). However, for 120
of 128 datasets (93.8%) the lowest MIG tree belonged to the Bayesian
sample and for 127 of 128 (99.2%) datasets the Bayesian sample included
the highest MIG tree.

An average may not provide a good accounting of the variation in the
results for each dataset. In Fig. 2A and 2B, we show a dataset from
Demar (2013). The treespace for this dataset can be seen in Fig. 2C.
This suggests a highly structured treespace: because Bayesian MCMC
samples in proportion to the posterior probability, we infer from the
shape of this treespace visualization that there are two peaks to this
distribution that contained fairly good trees. There are three
most-parsimonious trees; two are sampled from one peak with poor
stratigraphic fit, one is sampled from the peak with fairly good
stratigraphic fit. In this case, averaging is unlikely to produce a
value that represents either peak adequately, and the average in this
case is a value that does not belong to a tree that was sampled in the
analysis at all.

In the case of the Yates (2003) dataset, treespace appears to be sampled
much more evenly. In this case, taking an average might represent the
sample better. Even so, there are a number of problems with comparing
means. As shown in the boxplots of Fig. 1, the mean and variance for the
parsimony estimates are almost wholly subsumed in the Bayesian posterior
sample. This is largely expected: the Bayesian posterior sample
encompasses all trees sampled in the analysis (typically thinned by some
proportion as they are exported from the tree estimation software). The
set of most parsimonious trees contains a sample of the best trees
according to an optimality criterion (fewest implied evolutionary
steps). Assuming both estimation criteria are using the same data to
sample the same treespace, we would expect that averaging among only the
best trees should produce better stratigraphic congruence. In other
words, the typical implementation of the parsimony criterion should be
set up to appear superior to the typical Bayesian implementation.
However, looking across all the datasets, only a slight improvement is
seen from this biased averaging (Table S1, Sansom *et al.* 2018, their
Fig. 1).

Which analytical method produces better stratigraphic congruence is the
wrong question. A better question to ask may be "How can researchers
explore and quantify variation in their sets of solutions?". Here we
argue a key but underappreciated visualization tool (treespace) may be
especially useful. Implementations of such tools have been in place for
well over a decade (Hillis *et al.* 2005), but we are unaware of them
being used in any published analysis of samples of trees produced from
morphological data. We also note our treespaces appear to exhibit many
different kinds of relationships across the datasets examined here. For
example, single or multiple-tree islands far separate from the rest of
the sample, apparently smooth or volatile gradients of stratigraphic
congruence, parsimony samples enveloped by Bayesian samples, or
parsimony and Bayesian samples occupying different parts of the space.
We note that such visualizations are necessarily exploratory---they
represent an attempt to collapse variation in a high-dimensional space
into a bivariate plot---but the diversity of the observed landscapes
certainly suggests further investigation of many of these patterns is
warranted.

## CONCLUSION

In this manuscript we have shown that "parsimony versus Bayesian"
comparisons do not have a simple outcome that is consistent across all
empirical data sets. Instead, we present a modified version of an
underutilized set of tools already available in the R programming
language that can better help workers visualize and understand large
posterior samples, either on their own or in the context of maximum
parsimony trees. In particular, we urge the exploration of treespace
visualizations to better understand the output from phylogenetic
inference. We show that these tools suggest a huge variety of outcomes
in the occupation, shape and landscape of such spaces. More complex
visualizations of treespace have never been more tractable for the
average researcher and we look forward to many years of interesting
analyses about how different methods explore and sample phylogenetic
treespace.

FIGURE CAPTIONS AND TABLES

![](../Figures/Fig1.png)

**FIG. 1.** Plots showing Minimum Implied Gap score (MIG) for the
posterior sample and set of most parsimonious trees for the Yates (2003)
dataset. Panel A shows boxplots of the distributios of MIG scores, as in
Sansom *et al.* (2018). Panel B shows the same data, but as a violin
plot with points overlain. Panel C shows a treespace visualization, with
points colored by MIG score. Large points indicate parsimony trees.

![](../Figures/Fig3.png)

**FIG. 2.** Plots showing Minimum Implied Gap score (MIG) for the
posterior sample and set of most parsimonious trees for the Demar (2013)
dataset. Plot types and labels are the same as in Fig. 1. In contrast to
Fig. 1, there are defined regions of treespace in which trees with
better MIG scores are found.

**FIG. 3.** Interpolated tree "landscape" (sensu St John 2016) in 3D
(upper left) and plan view (upper right), where horizontal axes
represent position in the ordination space and vertical axis/colours
indicate stratigraphic congruence (Minimum Implied Gap; MIG). Note that
trees proximal in the space (A, B) can have very different MIGs, whereas
trees distant in the space (A, C) can have very similar or even
identical MIGs. (Code to reproduce the plot is available in Lloyd and
Wright 2020.)

| Metric | Reference(s) | Meaning | Range |
|--------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Stratigraphic Consistency Index (SCI) | [@huelsenbeck1994] | Proportion of nodes for which the oldest descendent of that node is younger than the oldest descendent of that node's ancestor | 0 to 1, with one being perfectly consistent |
| Minimum Implied Gap (MIG) | [@norell1992a; @norell1992 | The sum of the branch lengths excluding tip durations | Positive numbers in millions of years |
| Relative Completeness Index (RCI) | [@benton1994] | MIG score proportional to the summed length of tip durations | All real numbers |
| Manhattan Stratigraphic Measure (MSM*) | [@siddall1998stratigraphic; @pol2001comments | MIG for the maximally stratigraphically consistent possible tree divided by the actual MIG | 0 to 1, with one being the most consistent |
| Gap Excess Ratio (GER) | [@wills1999congruence; @wills2008modified] | MIG minus the best possible stratigraphic fit, scaled by the contrast between the best and worst fit values | 0 to 1, with one being the most consistent |

> Table 1: - Summary of the common stratigraphic congruence metrics used. Here we prefer the MIG as our primary cmparative metric as it both captures absolute fit to the fossil record and is the primary driver of three other metrics (RCI, MSM, GER).

**TABLE 2.** Summary of the MIG values for the two figured example data
sets, showing that neither Bayesian nor parsimony inferred trees
consistently have the best fit (lowest MIG), contra Sansom *et al.*
(2018).
